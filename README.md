# Godziny

"Godziny" is an react app designed for the presidium of a trade union's workers council to plan the so-called union hours. In Poland, the presidium of the trade union's council is entitled to use hours for union activities. Once the number of hours for the month is determined, the members of the presidium provide the employer with data on the number of hours taken on specific days of the month. Subsequently, the employer can either accept or reject the request for union hours.

## Application functionality

- The application have only a login function as it is intended for a predetermined number of council members, ranging from 5 to 20 individuals.
- After logging in, the user is redirected to the URL corresponding to the current month.
- Next, the user need to submit the basic month structure in settings panel.
- Then, the user provides the number of all hours available for utilization in the given month for all presidium of a council.
- Subsequently in month panel, the users can fill in the details form about the days on which will use the union hours. The data for each day will be saved on a tile within the respective "submited hours" column.
- Once the hours are approved or rejected by the management of the workplace, the users can move the tile to the appropriate column.
- If necessary, the user can delete tiles from a column.
- The total hours, submited hours, remaining hours available for all uses are calculated in real-time.
- If multiple months are created, the user can view the records specific to a particular month.

 ## Comments
* The Firebase Config keys are not hidden in the .env file to allow access for setting up the project locally.
 
* The data structure written in JSON and and stored in the Firebase Realtime Database follows a pattern where each year contains multiple months, and each month holds detailed information. For example:

![Zrzut ekranu (277)](https://github.com/Krzysztofe/godziny/assets/96065197/5c8be24d-f17e-4fb1-8bbb-888da3dbb2d8)


* To optimize data retrieval from the database and at the same have access to a list of dates of all saved months in database, a snapshot from the Realtime Database is utilized. This snapshot relies on a WebSocket connection, which, when functioning correctly, results in an HTTP 101 response code. The snapshot listener retrieves keys from the database, encompassing only data of recorded years and months. Subsequently, these keys are transferred to an array, forming a list of months printed in settings panel. This approach restricts HTTP requests to the database to all years and months, without fetching the rest of the data recorded for each month.


* To achieve global access to variables and functions, Redux Toolkit was implemented. However, to avoid prop drilling within components in lists iterated by the map() method, local Context was utilized.

* On the mobile version of aplication, the drag and drop functionality is not well supported on touch events. It works in the following way: when you press on a tile with information about a day, a black border appears around the tile and its background becomes transparent. To make a change, you need to release your finger and then touch the tile again to drag it to the desired column.

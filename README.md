# Godziny - React/TS, Express, Mongoose

"Godziny" is full-stack commercial project designed for the presidium of a trade union's workers council to plan the so-called union hours. In Poland, the presidium of the trade union's council is entitled to use hours for union activities. Once the number of hours for the month is determined, the members of the presidium provide the employer with data on the number of hours taken on specific days of the month. Subsequently, the employer can either accept or reject the request for union hours.

 ## Comments
* URLs are not hidden in the .env file to allow access for setting up the project locally.
 
* To achieve global access to variables and functions, Redux Toolkit was implemented. However, to avoid prop drilling within components in lists iterated by the map() method, local Context was utilized.

* On the mobile version of aplication, the drag and drop functionality is not well supported on touch events. It works in the following way: when you press on a tile with information about a day, a black border appears around the tile and its background becomes transparent. To make a change, you need to release your finger and then touch the tile again to drag it to the desired column.

* The structure of the month data stored in MongoDB Atlas is as follows:
